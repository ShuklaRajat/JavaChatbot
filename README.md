A java based application which recognizes the speech, converts to text, processes the required information and converts this text information into speech as output.
A java based application which recognizes the speech, converts to text, processes the required information and converts this text information into speech as output. For making this project i have used CMU Sphinx4 which converted my speech into text. Refer https://cmusphinx.github.io/wiki/tutorial/  for tutorial to how to go through the process.
The speech is recognized and is then processed accordingly based upon a grammar file and also a sequence if-else-if statements. The processing will lead to a result which will be "SPOKEN" as output. This has been made possible due to a MarryTTS library. For further information refer http://mary.dfki.de/index.html . 
The application is able to perform basic mathematical operations, talk to people based upon the sentences in the library and is also capable of playing mp3 music. SInce JAVA does not support mp3 format music, i have used JLayer library. All the required libraries can be found inside libraries folder. You just have to build path for each one of them.
